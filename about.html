      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores how violence shaped the Civil Rights Movement through the lens of memory. Using oral histories from the Library of Congress Civil Rights History Project, it focuses on how individuals remembered, responded to, and reflected on major violent events between 1955 and 1968. Rather than merely documenting what happened, this project centers <strong>how people felt</strong>, <strong>what they remembered</strong>, and <strong>how memory itself became a tool for resistance</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is built as a digital mini-site combining narrative writing, data visualizations, mapping, and archival images to humanize and historicize the emotional landscape of civil rights violence.

      <h2>Processing</h2>
      <p>
        To analyze memory and violence across interviews:
        <ul>
          <li>Created a <strong>Google Sheet dataset</strong> tagging events, types of violence, emotions, and interviewees.</li>
          <li>Used <strong>Voyant Tools</strong> to analyze frequency and context of key terms (“fear,” “jail,” “police,” etc.).</li>
          <li>Applied <strong>close reading</strong> methods to extract meaningful quotes and connect them to historical context.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
