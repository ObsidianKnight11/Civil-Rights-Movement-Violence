        Throughout the 1960s, Black citizens attempting to register to vote or exercise their political rights were met with lethal violence and intimidation. From beatings and shootings to bombings and arson, these acts were deliberate measures to disenfranchise Black voters and maintain racial hierarchies. The persistent threat created a climate of fear that activists had to overcome through immense personal sacrifice.
