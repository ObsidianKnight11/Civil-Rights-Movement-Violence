      <h2>What the Dataset Includes</h2>
      <p>
        This project draws from a qualitative dataset built from oral history transcripts in the Library of Congress Civil Rights History Project. The dataset documents:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Major events of violence between 1955 and 1968</li>
        <li>Personal accounts from interviewees who remembered or responded to those events</li>
        <li>Types of violence (police brutality, bombings, assassinations, political intimidation, hate crimes)</li>
        <li>Emotional responses (fear, anger, grief, pride, silence, defiance)</li>
        <li>Locations, perpetrators (where known), and connections to activism</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each entry represents a human memory, often brief, sometimes detailed, in which violence shaped an interviewee's life, community, or political action.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the Dataset Can Illuminate</h2>
      <p>
        This dataset is designed to highlight patterns in how violence was remembered across multiple people, locations, and events. It reveals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which events generated strong emotional memory (e.g., Emmett Till's murder, MLK's assassination)</li>
        <li>How certain types of violence were common triggers for resistance</li>
        <li>Where and how violence was used to suppress activism</li>
        <li>How memory worked emotionally and strategically: fear led to both silence and action</li>
        <li>What kinds of violence were recalled, and which were left unspoken</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By tagging emotions and themes, the dataset allows for discovery of emotional and historical patterns across a broad personal archive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the Dataset Leaves Out</h2>
      <p>
        Like all datasets, this one is shaped by its sources and structure. It does <strong>not</strong> include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full transcripts — only excerpts or summary-level insights</li>
        <li>Interviewees who did not speak about violence or were not included in the archive</li>
        <li>Broader social data (e.g., newspaper coverage, FBI surveillance, legal records)</li>
        <li>The full emotional depth of each moment — some memories are flattened in structure</li>
        <li>Unspoken, silenced, or unrecorded trauma — memory gaps matter but are invisible in this dataset</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ontology: What Counts as “Data” Here?</h2>
      <p>
        This project treats <strong>memory fragments</strong> as data points, which is both useful and problematic. By reducing emotion-laden recollections to tags and categories, we risk stripping away complexity. For example, “fear” might look like one theme, but it could come from multiple sources: fear of death, fear for a child, fear of retaliation. Similarly, “violence” is not always physical, legal threats, social exile, and surveillance are also violent in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision to tag memories by type, location, and emotional tone is an interpretive act. It reflects the project's goal to analyze how violence was remembered, but it also imposes structure on stories that resist neat boundaries. This is a reminder that digital humanities projects, even when well-intentioned, always reflect editorial and ideological choices.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideological Effects</h2>
      <p>
        The process of turning memory into data reveals more than patterns, it exposes tension. Some memories survive because they were recorded, others because they were repeated within families. Some voices are louder in the archive because they were more public, or more comfortable speaking. By focusing on memory of violence, this project risks re-traumatizing or sensationalizing, yet it also creates space for honoring what was lived and lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        This data critique is a reminder that memory is not just something we study; it is something we shape by how we structure, tag, and present it.
