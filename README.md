# Remembering Violence in the Civil Rights Movement

This digital project explores how key moments of violence shaped memory, resistance, and strategy during the Civil Rights Movement. Using firsthand accounts, historical sources, and visual storytelling, the project focuses on a few major events:

- The Murder of Emmett Till (1955)
- The Freedom Rides (1961)
- The Bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church (1963)
- Killings and assaults during voting rights campaigns (1964-65)
- The Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1968)

The project draws from oral histories in the Library of Congress Civil Rights History Project and places a special emphasis on how survivors and witnesses remember violence â€” emotionally, strategically, and politically.
