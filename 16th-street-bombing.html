        In September 1963, a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young African American girls. This atrocity exposed the lethal nature of racial terrorism and served as a catalyst for civil rights reforms. The tragedy remains one of the most searing examples of hate-driven violence in American history.
