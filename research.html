      <h2>Narrative</h2>

      <article>
        <p>In August 1955, the brutal lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi marked a horrifying threshold in the long history of American racial violence. His murder, for allegedly whistling at a white woman, became a national symbol after his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral to show the world the mutilation inflicted on her child. The image of Till's disfigured body, published in <em>Jet Magazine</em>, shocked millions and helped galvanize support for what would become the modern Civil Rights Movement.</p>

        <p>Oral histories in the Library of Congress archive reveal how deeply this event imprinted itself on young activists, particularly those in the South. While not everyone personally knew Till, many described his death as the moment they understood the stakes of racial violence, that even children were targets. Activists like Dr. Lawrence Guyot have reflected on how the photo and the silence surrounding it shaped their sense of responsibility. In his interview, he stated, “That image... you never forget that. You don't want to. That was when we stopped waiting.” Remembering Till is not simply about recalling tragedy, it is also about recalling purpose. The story of Emmett Till lives on in memory not just as a wound but as a warning, a rallying cry, and a foundational moral horror that continues to shape the emotional architecture of Black resistance.</p>

        <p>In 1961, a group of interracial activists boarded buses throughout the South in an organized protest against segregated interstate travel. These activists, known as the Freedom Riders, sought to test the Supreme Court rulings Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which had declared segregated travel unconstitutional. The Freedom Rides were not just a legal test—they were a bold confrontation with Southern white supremacy, and they were met with immediate, brutal violence. Buses were attacked, set on fire, and riders were dragged out and beaten by mobs with the tacit approval, or outright cooperation, of local law enforcement. In Anniston, Alabama, one bus was firebombed while police refused to intervene. In Birmingham, Freedom Riders were beaten while the police “stood down” for fifteen minutes. In Jackson, Mississippi, Riders were arrested en masse and sent to Parchman Farm, a notorious prison where they were denied basic rights and subjected to psychological abuse.</p>
        
        <p>While these incidents are well-documented, the oral histories reveal the personal stakes. Activists describe feeling fear, defiance, and even calmness in the face of physical threat. Jean Young recalled, “We knew the buses might get bombed. That wasn't a possibility, it was an expectation.” Others reflected on the power of shared struggle: “The smoke, the fists, the blood—we expected that. What we didn't expect was how proud our families were.” These memories complicate any romanticized view of the Freedom Rides as purely heroic; they were terrifying, exhausting, and deeply traumatizing experiences. Yet violence did not stop the movement—in many cases, it fueled it. National media coverage of the beatings and firebombings led to growing support for federal intervention and greater public sympathy for civil rights causes. The Riders' resilience in the face of brutality transformed them into symbols of courage, but more importantly, their memory remains a record of how bodies were placed in harm's way to expose the cruelty of white supremacy. These remembered experiences are not simply historical facts; they are emotional records of the cost of change.</p>

        <p>On the morning of September 15, 1963, a powerful bomb ripped through the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young Black girls: Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Denise McNair. The church had served as a central meeting place for civil rights organizers, children's marches, and voter registration drives. Its destruction was not random, it was a deliberate act of racial terror carried out by Ku Klux Klan members in response to growing civil rights activity in the city. The bombing marked one of the darkest moments in the history of the Civil Rights Movement. It wasn't just the brutality of the act, but the profound symbolism of attacking a sacred space, one meant for worship, safety, and community. In the days that followed, the tragedy sparked national outrage and drew attention to the depth of resistance to desegregation in the South. However, it also left an unhealed scar on the emotional landscape of Black America. </p>
        
        <p>Oral histories reflect the deep trauma and emotional fragmentation the bombing caused. Jennifer Lawson, who was in Birmingham at the time, recalled, “That church was ours. We held hands there. Sang there. After the bombing, it felt like no place was sacred.” For many, it wasn't just the death of four girls—it was the destruction of something bigger: the sense that Black spaces could ever be free from white violence. These memories have been passed down in families, communities, and activist networks. Some remember the silence of the adults afterward, the way grief sat unspoken in the air. Others remember how the bombing shifted their understanding of what the movement required of them. For a generation of activists, this moment underscored that their work was not just dangerous, it was deadly. The memory of the church bombing continues to shape how civil rights violence is understood and remembered. It is recalled not only for its horror, but for its impact: within a year, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, and the Birmingham movement remained a case study in courage, resilience, and the cost of change. Remembering this event today means honoring the girls not only as victims, but as figures whose deaths galvanized a movement and whose lives remain symbols of innocence lost to hate.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout the 1960s, Black Americans who tried to vote in the South faced not only legal barriers, but constant threats of violence. While literacy tests and poll taxes were designed to disenfranchise, physical intimidation, arrests, job loss, and murder were often used to enforce that suppression. This violence was not hidden, it was direct, public, and meant to send a message: Black political participation would not be tolerated. The 1964 Freedom Summer campaign brought hundreds of young volunteers to Mississippi to register Black voters and build political power. Almost immediately, three activists, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, disappeared. Their bodies were later found buried in an earthen dam, beaten and shot. This wasn't an isolated event; it was part of a larger pattern of deadly force used to suppress democracy. In 1965, after a peaceful march in Selma turned violent when police and white mobs attacked demonstrators on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, an event now known as "Bloody Sunday"—activist Jimmie Lee Jackson was murdered by police during a related protest. His death helped inspire the Selma-to-Montgomery marches. </p>
        
        <p>Oral histories show how pervasive the fear of violence was during these campaigns. As Junius Williams reflected, “Trying to register to vote could cost you your job, your home, your life. We knew that, and we went anyway.” For many, activism was not a distant decision, it was a daily risk. Organizers recall being chased out of towns, beaten by police, or threatened by employers. Despite this, communities often chose to act, driven by faith, courage, and the hope that their sacrifice would lead to a better future. These memories are vital not just as historical documentation, but as emotional records of the cost of political participation. The risk was not abstract. It lived in the decisions people made to walk into courthouses, attend meetings in churches, or drive volunteers to the next town. Remembering the violence that accompanied the voting rights struggle reminds us that the ballot was, and remains, a contested, dangerous tool of power. It also reveals the extraordinary bravery of those who demanded the right to use it.</p>
        
        <p>On April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. He had come to support striking sanitation workers, Black laborers protesting dangerous conditions and unequal pay. His death shocked the nation and triggered an outpouring of grief, as well as violent uprisings in over 100 American cities. More than just the loss of a leader, King's assassination was felt as a moment of profound spiritual rupture: the man who preached nonviolence had been killed by a bullet. In many ways, King's death marked the symbolic end of the nonviolent civil rights era and the beginning of a more radical, disillusioned phase of Black political struggle. While King had already begun to critique economic inequality and U.S. militarism, his assassination crystalized a sense among many activists that peaceful protest alone would not be enough. Some turned toward Black Power. Others focused on building institutions and reclaiming community control. Many simply mourned. </p>
        
        
        <p>Oral histories reflect the complexity of these responses. Timothy Jenkins recalled the silence that followed hearing the news: “I heard it on the radio. And I just sat there, like the world had ended.” Others describe feeling fear for their children, despair over what had been lost, or renewed commitment to carry on his vision. Some interviews reveal a quiet rage, not just at the assassin, but at a system that had allowed, and arguably encouraged, violence against Black leaders. King's death remains one of the most widely memorialized acts of political violence in American history, yet oral histories offer a perspective less frequently seen in public commemorations. They capture confusion, exhaustion, and the terrifying realization that change would not come quickly or safely. His assassination is not just remembered as a tragedy, but as a moment that demanded reflection: What had been achieved? What had been lost? What must still be done? In remembering King through the voices of those who lived that moment, we see not just a man martyred for justice, but a movement forced to confront its limits, its direction, and its future. </p>

      <article>
        <p><strong>Sullivan, Patricia. <em>Freedom Rights: New Perspectives on the Civil Rights Movement</em>. University Press of Kentucky, 2012.</strong><br>
        Sullivan reframes the Civil Rights Movement as a long, deeply-rooted fight for broad-based “freedom rights,” not just legal desegregation. She emphasizes the role of lesser-known rural activists and the dangers they faced. This source is valuable for its attention to local memory and for how it challenges overly simplistic narratives focused on major leaders. It informs the project's focus on emotional memory and grassroots responses to violence.</p>

        <p><strong>Chafe, William H. “History Matters.” In <em>An Unfamiliar America</em>, edited by Nadine Farghaly and Simon Bacon, Taylor & Francis, 2022, pp. 229-246.</strong><br>
        Chafe argues that the Civil Rights Movement was the product of long-term community organizing and strategic moral positioning, not just spontaneous action. His work sheds light on the tension between idealism and pragmatism, especially within Black leadership. This is relevant to understanding how some activists responded to violence with calls for nonviolence while others reevaluated their strategies.</p>

        <p><strong>Edmonds, Michael, editor. <em>Risking Everything: A Freedom Summer Reader</em>. Wisconsin Historical Society Press, 2014.</strong><br>

        Payne provides one of the most detailed studies of grassroots organizing in the Deep South, showing how local people sustained activism in spite of threats, beatings, and bombings. He critiques overemphasis on national leaders and media moments. This book supports the project's effort to center lived experience and community memory.</p>

        <p><strong>McAdam, Doug. <em>Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, 1930-1970.</em>University of Chicago Press, 1999.</strong><br>
        McAdam offers a political science perspective on how social movements form, grow, and respond to repression. He analyzes how the threat of violence shapes strategic decisions. This source helps the project frame violence not just as trauma, but as a force that shifts activism, timing, and public visibility.</p>

        <p><strong>Theoharis, Jeanne.  <em>A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History</em>. Beacon Press, 2018.</strong><br>
        Theoharis critiques how mainstream narratives have sanitized civil rights history, often minimizing state violence and radical Black organizing. She emphasizes the importance of memory and whose stories get told. This source supports the project's critique of selective remembrance and gives theoretical grounding to its focus on oral history and structural erasure.</p>
