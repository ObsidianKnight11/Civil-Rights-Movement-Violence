      <h2>Narrative</h2>
      <p><em>Note: This section is still in progress and will be updated.</em></p>

      <article>
        <p>In August 1955, the brutal lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi marked a horrifying threshold in the long history of American racial violence. His murder, for allegedly whistling at a white woman, became a national symbol after his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral to show the world the mutilation inflicted on her child. The image of Till's disfigured body, published in <em>Jet Magazine</em>, shocked millions and helped galvanize support for what would become the modern Civil Rights Movement.</p>

        <p>Oral histories in the Library of Congress archive reveal how deeply this event imprinted itself on young activists, particularly those in the South. While not everyone personally knew Till, many described his death as the moment they understood the stakes of racial violence, that even children were targets. Activists like Dr. Lawrence Guyot have reflected on how the photo and the silence surrounding it shaped their sense of responsibility. In his interview, he stated, “That image... you never forget that. You don't want to. That was when we stopped waiting.” Remembering Till is not simply about recalling tragedy, it is also about recalling purpose. The story of Emmett Till lives on in memory not just as a wound but as a warning, a rallying cry, and a foundational moral horror that continues to shape the emotional architecture of Black resistance.</p>

      <h2>Annotated Bibliography</h2>

      <article>
        <p><strong>Sullivan, Patricia. <em>Freedom Rights: New Perspectives on the Civil Rights Movement</em>. University Press of Kentucky, 2012.</strong><br>
        Sullivan reframes the Civil Rights Movement as a long, deeply-rooted fight for broad-based “freedom rights,” not just legal desegregation. She emphasizes the role of lesser-known rural activists and the dangers they faced. This source is valuable for its attention to local memory and for how it challenges overly simplistic narratives focused on major leaders. It informs the project's focus on emotional memory and grassroots responses to violence.</p>

        <p><strong>Chafe, William H. “History Matters.” In <em>An Unfamiliar America</em>, edited by Nadine Farghaly and Simon Bacon, Taylor & Francis, 2022, pp. 229-246.</strong><br>
        Chafe argues that the Civil Rights Movement was the product of long-term community organizing and strategic moral positioning, not just spontaneous action. His work sheds light on the tension between idealism and pragmatism, especially within Black leadership. This is relevant to understanding how some activists responded to violence with calls for nonviolence while others reevaluated their strategies.</p>

        <p><strong>Edmonds, Michael, editor. <em>Risking Everything: A Freedom Summer Reader</em>. Wisconsin Historical Society Press, 2014.</strong><br>
        This collection includes letters, oral testimonies, and documents from volunteers during Freedom Summer. The personal nature of the texts offers insight into the emotional toll of the work and the ever-present threat of violence. It contributes to the project's use of oral histories and analysis of personal memory under pressure.</p>
