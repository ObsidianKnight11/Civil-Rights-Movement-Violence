        In August 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was brutally murdered in Mississippi for allegedly offending a white woman. His mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, demanded an open-casket funeral that exposed the nation's brutality and ignited a wave of national outrage. This tragedy not only highlighted the extreme racism of the era but also became a powerful symbol of the need for change.
